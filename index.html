    Somewhere in life, we sometimes fail and we sometimes get hurt, but there’s always someone behind who would inspire us to outshine ourselves in doing enormous things. They are the reason why we stand up again and learn to mend our wounds. They are our inspiration in life, our motivator and our strength to reach success. It has always been a part of our life’s voyage to encounter different challenges in life. In every achievement, frustrations, and happiness in my life, my parents are always there at my side to guide and prop me up. I am so overwhelmed and grateful for I have them as my parents. They are my inspiration in doing magnificent things in my life. Seeing them suffering while working too hard under the heat of the sun just to give us a good future inspires me. Because of their efforts and warm love, I am so inspired to study hard and be more persevered in achieving all my dreams in life. Having a debt of gratitude to them, I want to pay all their hard works by giving them a sufficient and marvelous life someday. I am studying hard not only for myself but also for my family. Without them, I am nothing. Let us not think that having an inspiration is an interference towards achieving something. Instead, let us think that it is a way on how we are motivated to reach our goals in life. Let's be inspired by the people around us who truly love and support us in all the ways we take in life.
